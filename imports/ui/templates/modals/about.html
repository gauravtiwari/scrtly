    <h1>Catharsis & Connection</h1>
    <p>
      The year is 1999. I am home from college. It is 3am,
      and I am sitting at my family's computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glow from the screen is the only light in an otherwise dark study.
      I am anonymous.And I am reading another anonymous person's story
      about her life-long regret of having an abortion when she was sixteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comments on the post expose a sense of empathy and support
      from other readers. The experience invokes a sense of hope and
      wonder within me.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment in time, the internet feels like amorphous,
      uncharted territory, a nebulous, infinite landscape, serving
      as a haphazard community space for people's inner worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The power and benefit of anonymity unleashed. Catharsis for us
      to share private thoughts we otherwise never do.
      Connection through personal, intimate stories.
    </p>
    <p>But the importance of that type of space quickly fades. </p>
    <p>
      As the internet races towards identification, verification,
      and perpetual tracking, it forsakes anonymity. A vital organ of the
      internet cannibalized, and with it that community space for our inner life.
    </p>
    <p>Scrt.ly is determined to reinvigorate that arena.</p>
